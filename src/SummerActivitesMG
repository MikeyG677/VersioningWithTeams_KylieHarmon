    Over the summer I worked full-time at The Home Depot by my home town Hammond,IN. It was an interesting experience
    because they never had a set schedule for me, so in a sense I was always on call. Other then working, I took part in
    a summer bowling league with my close friends. The league was a recreational league and at the end we get a "free"
    bowling ball. I spent majority of my free time with family and friends, especially my german shepherd Apollo.
    I realised hanging out with friends becomes more diffuclt with age as everyone is always busy with their work or
    significant others. This was one of the few summers that I actually enjoyed due to not being away for the summer.
